# CS50x_FinalProject
My first independently designed web application: Budgeting web app modeled after YNAB. Built on the Flask and Bootstrap frame works using Python, SQLite, Javascript, CSS, HTML, and Regex. Supports multiple budgets, budget groups and categories, allocations and expenses, transaction history, goal setting, dynamic routes, and dynamic HTML pages via Javascript.
